Create and Maintain a cache of precompiled pod files

Module to take a collection of pod files and create a precompiled cache. Methods / functions
to add a pod file to a cache.

## Install

This module is in the [Raku ecosystem](https://modules.raku.org), so you
 install it in the usual way:

    zef install Pod::To::Cached

Although this module is usable, it will be soon substituted by [`Pod::From::Cached`](https://github.com/finanalyst/raku-pod-from-cache). So it's
 probably better if you try and adapt to that new module.

The module is now in maintenance mode, and only bugfixes will be released.

# SYNOPSIS
```perl6
use Pod::To::Cached;

my Pod::To::Cached $cache .= new(:path<path-to-cache>, :source<path-to-directory-with-pod-files>);

$cache.update-cache;

for $cache.hash-files.kv -> $source-name, $status {
    given $status {
        when 'Current' {say "｢$source-name｣ is up to date with POD source"}
        when 'Valid' {say "｢$source-name｣ has valid POD, but newer POD source contains invalid POD"}
        when 'Failed' {say "｢$source-name｣ is not in cache, and source file contains invalid POD"}
        when 'New' { say "｢$source-name｣ is not in cache and cache has not been updated"}
        when 'Old' { say "｢$source-name｣ is in cache, but has no associated pod file in DOC"}
    }
    user-supplied-routine-for-processing-pod( $cache.pod( $source-name ) );
}

# Find files with status
say 'These pod files failed:';
.say for $cache.list-files( 'Failed' );
say 'These sources have valid pod:';
.say for $cache.list-files(<Current Valid>);

# Find date when pod added to cache
my $source = 'language/pod'; # name of a documentation source
say "｢$source｣ was added on ｢{ $cache.cache-timestamp( $source ) }｣";

# Remove the dependence on the pod source
$cache.freeze;

```
## Notes
-  Str $!path = '.pod6-cache'  
    path to the directory where the cache will be created/kept

-  Str $!source = 'doc'  
    path to the collection of pod files
    ignored if cache frozen

-  @!extensions = <pod pod6>  
    the possible extensions for a POD file

-  verbose = False  
    Whether processing information is sent to stderr.

-  new  
    Instantiates class. On instantiation,
    - get the cache from index, or creates a new cache if one does not exist
    - if frozen, does not check the source directory
    - if not frozen, or new cache being created, verifies
        - source directory exists
        - the source directory contains POD/POD6 etc files (recursively)
        - no duplicate pod file names exist, eg. xx.pod & xx.pod6
    - verifies whether the cache is valid

-  update-cache  
    All files with a modified timestamp (reported by the filesystem) after the added instant are precompiled and added to the cache
    - Status is changed to Updated (compiles Valid) or Fail (does not compile)
    - Failed files that were previously Valid files still retain the old cache handle
    - Throws an exception when called on a frozen cache

-  freeze  
    Can be called only when there are only Valid or Updated (no New, Tainted or Failed files),
    otherwise dies.  
    The intent of this method is to allow the pod-cache to be copied without the original pod-files.  
    update-cache will throw an error if used on a frozen cache

-  list-files( Str $s --> Positional )
    returns an Sequence of files with the given status

-  list-files( Str $s1, $s2 --> Positional )
    returns an Array of files with the given status list

-  hash-files( *@statuses? --> Associative )
    returns a map of the source-name and its statuses
    -  explicitly give required status strings: C<< $cache.hash-files(<Old Failed>) >>
    -  return all files C< $cache.hash-files >

-  cache-timestamp( $source --> Instant )
    returns the Instant when a valid version of the Pod was added to the cache
    -  if the time-stamp is before the time the Pod was modified, then the pod has errors
    -  a Failed source has a timestamp of zero

-  pod
    - method pod(Str $source)
    - Returns an array of POD Objects generated from the file associated with $source name.
    - When a doc-set is being actively updated, then pod files may have failed, in which case they have Status Valid.
    - To froze a cache, all files must have Current status

-  Status is an enum with the following elements and semantics
    -  Current  
         There is a compiled source in the cache with an added date **after** the modified date
    -  Valid  
    There is a compiled source in the cache with an added date **before** the modified date and there has been an attempt to add the source to cache that did not compile
    -  Failed  
    There is not a compiled source in the cache, but there has been an attempt to add the source name to the cache that did not compile
    -  New  
    A new pod source has been detected that is not in cache, but C<update-cache> has not yet been called to compile the source. A transitional Status
    -  Old  
    A source name that is in the cache but no longer reflects an existing source.

    - **.cache-ignore**: You can create a file named `.cache-ignore` containing Perl 6 regular expressions. Pod6 filenames in `$source` matching at least one of the provided regexes, will be ignored.
